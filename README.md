# WebAppDev

This repository is where I store my code as I learn back-end development and devops principles. I am very interested in the different areas of web application development.


For the first few months I will be focusing on the specifics of server management and model deployment. After I feel reasonably comfortable in this areas, and am capable of deploying models to production,  I will start to work on parallel processing for model building as well as database management.
